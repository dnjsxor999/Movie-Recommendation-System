# Movie-Recommendation-System
Movie Recommendation System | Personal Project


- Designed algorithm to suggest the most relevant movies based on the content filtering by using the Feature Vectorizing,
TfidVectorizer (TF-IDF) and CountVectorizer to make cosine similarity to compare input movie name with other movies.
- Implemented SVD model to predict the user’s rate of new movie that user did not watch based on the rate history of
user’s movies and other related users’ rate history.
- Combined TMDB API to bring posters & titles to get input and show result in web application using the streamlit module.
